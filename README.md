Declarative transitions for svg.js

## Setup

To set this up, just run:

    npm install

from the base folder

## Running Examples

The examples found in the examples folder can be run with:

    npm run demo <folder-name>

Where folder name is the folder containing the demo you want to run. This will run a webpack dev server which usually runs at [port 8080 of your localhost](http://localhost:8080/), but it will print the correct port upon startup.

## Building the Source

Just run the build script and it will take care of building everything:

    npm run build

If you get any errors, fix them and try again!
